## Assignment Details

For this project, I will analyze a dog service company's user data and make marketing/strategy recommendations regarding user retention rate. For privacy reasons, this service's name is omitted from this analysis. The company provides a service for dog owners to connect to their dogs and see how their pet functions on a cognitive level. This assignment is the final project for Coursera's 'Data Visualization and Communication With Tableau' course developed by Duke University.
